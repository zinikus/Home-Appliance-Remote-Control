# Home Appliance Remote Control

This project allows you to control home appliances (like lights, fans, etc.) from your smartphone over the internet using an ESP-based microcontroller.

## Features

- Control appliances from anywhere using a smartphone
- Built using ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller
- Real-time control via Wi-Fi
- Easy-to-use mobile interface (can integrate with Blynk, Firebase, or HTTP server)

## Components Needed

- ESP8266 or ESP32
- Relay module
- Power source
- Jumper wires
- Smartphone

## Getting Started

1. Flash the `home_auto.ino` file to your ESP device.
2. Modify the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and server endpoints.
3. Connect the relays to your home appliances.
4. Use a mobile app (like Blynk or your own custom app) to control them.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you'll be able to switch your appliances on or off from your phone from anywhere with internet access.
